                            The solutions we found for improving privacy in CODIS focus on encryption algorithms for matching
                            single samples against the entire database. The two parties - the FBI and the lab testing the sample - 
                            should not learn the other's information in the process of checking for a match. Otherwise, there would
                            be too many labs containing the entirety of CODIS, and the FBI would have DNA data from suspects that had 
                            not yet been convicted. The first two publications examined are specific to CODIS, whereas the third is a 
                            general encryption algorithm that could be applied to CODIS.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The first solution is from "Genomic Encryption of Biometric Information for Privacy-Preserving Forensics",
                            by Jung, Karl and Siwo. It is an elegant solution in which the STRs of records in the database become their 
                            own Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) keys, the encrypted data stored directly in CODIS. Then, the testing
                            sample STRs are used to decrypt the entire database, revealing a full match in readable form if one exists. 
                            This solution is not only helpful in everyday operation of CODIS, but should the entire database become compromised,
                            none of it would be readable regardless. However, this solution does necessitate a full match, and would require 
                            all of the pre-existing records within CODIS to be transformed. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The second solution we looked at was from researchers at Philips Research Europe, Information and System Security Group,
                            in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, as well as from the Technische UniversitÂ¨at Darmstadt, Security Engineering Group,
                            Darmstadt, Germany. They proposed several protocols for DNA identity, paternity, and ancestry testing. The identity testing,
                            which closest aligns with the 'hit' goals of CODIS, uses ElGamal encryption. This is more secure against hostile actors than the 
                            other two solutions found, and can account for small degrees of partial matching in the samples, but is not as efficient. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The third solution comes from Hao Chen, Kim Laine, and Peter Rindal, of Microsoft Research and Oregon State. 
                            Their Private Set Intersection (PSI) algorithm greatly improves upon the time efficiency of previous 
                            fully homomorphic encryptions to solve the same issue. It also applies well to the FBI-sender and lab-receiver model,
                            in which the size of the sender's dataset is much larger than the receiver's (only a single datapoint). Their computation
                            is linear in the size of the smaller set and logarithmic in the size of the larger set. The algorithm itself has batching 
                            and hashing optimizations on top on a given fully homomorphic encryption scheme, and requires the sender to compute the 
                            intersection of the encrypted sets via dot product. However fast this solution is, there are a few flaws. Requiring the sender
                            (FBI) to compute the intersection is likely to cause bottlenecks. Also, after running, the receiver remains only with
                            a yes/no of whether a match was found, not the accessory information within the record it matched to, such as its ID number.
